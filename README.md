Hi! 

Hi! I'm James, an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building applications and continuously improving them with new features. My journey into software development began when I created a simple music player GUI. Seeing it come to life sparked a deep interest in programming and sharing it with family and friends made me realize how rewarding it is to bring ideas to life through code.

Currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Brandeis University, I’ve worked on projects like leading the development of a React Native app with over 1,600 daily users and building a payroll anomaly detection feature during my internship at Zebra Technologies. My leadership experiences as an instructor, TA, and IT technician have also taught me how to communicate technical concepts clearly and collaborate effectively.

I enjoy tackling challenges across the tech stack and am always excited to build innovative solutions. Let’s connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!
