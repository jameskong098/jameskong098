Hi! 

My name is James Kong, and I am an undergraduate at Brandeis University pursuing a B.S degree in Computer Science. I have always had a mindset of perseverance, and I welcome all 
forms of collaboration with others. I have experience with OOP and data structures in Java from school courses and independent projects made for fun. I am currently studying operating systems and software 
engineering principles such as shell programming and scripting using bash and makefiles, releasing apps using containers using docker, and etc. During my spare time, I also enjoy teaching introductory 
Python to younger kids, as I currently teach ages 8-18 at Juni Learning. I also like to play various kinds of video games, whether it be on the nintendo switch or on my gaming laptop. Feel free
to colloborate on something cool or just hit me up for a game!
